\section{Crypto Currency}
\subsection{Ripple and B-Money}
\begin{flushleft}
    When it comes to crypto currency, before the well-known Bitcoin, the entire crypto community has begun to experiment on a better international payment channel, such as Dai-Wei's Ripple and B-Money.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    Ripple has been used in the settlement between banks in different countries, but never became quite as popular as was Bitcoin, because it is considered too centralized for a crypto currency. Compared to those decentralized crypto currencies, Ripple has always been more appealing to enterprise and business users, but less to the crypto enthusiasts, because its token generation procedure does not involve or incentivize the crypto enthusiasts.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    B-Money causes network congestion due to the need for network synchronization in its design. At that time, the network speed was not so fast. During the sending and receiving of currency, network lag often caused problems, sometimes user receives no reply while waiting for a network packet. The system was impractical for mass adoption.
\end{flushleft}
\subsection{Nakomato Consensus}
\begin{flushleft}
    Then Bitcoin came to stage with its own Nakamoto consensus, which is the asynchronous PoW consensus. In the early days, no one was optimistic about this project. The consensus did not use simultaneous transactions to ensure that transaction results are right, but instead adopted a very interesting mechanism: the longest chain. That is to say, in this distributed system, the nodes manipulates packages and composes the chain, which includes the transaction with the correct result. For this specific package to appear, of course, the nodes in this system have to jointly verify. Only given a timeout package and only when more people participate in the accreditation before timeout, will this package reach consensus.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    In this system, there is a situation where nodes can collectively do bad things, so that the correct transaction is not packaged, and the transmission of the network is invalid. Since asynchronous system avoids excessive communication in the network, it is more suitable for multiple-step transactions, While the risk of this mechanism lies with the possibility of the majority of CPU power being controlled by dishonest nodes. A good example is the later appeared $51\%$ double spend attack. The last thing the financial system should do is to roll back or double spend, that is also why Bitcoin was not widely accepted at the beginning.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    Over time, a lot of participants joined the system for the financial benefits. Since the difficulty (for manipulating package mentioned above) of the system raised, the cost of harassing the working system has greatly increased for the bad guys. More stable the system, more profitable being honest rather than being dishonest. At this time, people began to realize the fascination of this crypto currency and numerous fans appeared. After years of difficulty increase, the BTC system has gradually stabilized, making it much harder to do double-spend or rollback. It also inspired the original teachings of Bitcoin, and gathered many crypto enthusiasts. It also inspired the original teachings of Bitcoin, and gathered many crypto enthusiasts. At this time, several new types of crypto currencies had been born or made by forks and copies, many got attacked because of their low computational power. The systems with low difficulty are unsafe and can be easily attacked, while highly available systems need tremendous energy consumption.
\end{flushleft}
\subsection{Bitcoin Features}
\begin{flushleft}
    Bitcoin was never aggressive on using new tech, but chose to adopt relatively mature technologies to build a safe and reliable Peer-to-Peer cash system. The more validated and simple the technology is, the more secure and trustworthy the system will be. For example, the SHA256 algorithm in Nakamoto consensus, is designed by NSA (US National Security Agency), with proven reliability. It seems that the initial design never considered the current ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) and power monopoly issues, but focused on pursuing ultimate system security, even sacrificed some of the high efficiency or high concurrency features of internet.
\end{flushleft}
\section{The Four Major Problems}
\begin{flushleft}
    Monopoly, centralization of computing power, high energy consumption, and the incompleteness of existing PoST have become the four major problems in the Crypto industry. From the beginning of its design, DePINC is aimed at solving the four major problems.
\end{flushleft}
\subsection{Monopoly}
\begin{flushleft}
    Since its inception, Bitcoin has always had the mission to solve financial institutions' crisis of confidence and issue of monopoly. Since the financial crisis in 2008, Nakamoto believed that the centralization of the financial system would lead to repetition of the history, thus decentralization could be an effective solution for the economy.

\begin{flushleft}
    So after all these years, what is the current status of Bitcoin?
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    The technology of Bitcoin-core is controlled by the core developers, and the code update speed is very slow, which can be described as code-centralization. Bitcoin's computing power is tremendous, ordinary people and personal computers cannot take part and can only trade in exchanges, which indicates hash-power-centralization. Bitcoin's block generation time is relatively slow, about 10 minutes per block, single digit TPS (Transaction per second) cannot provide the same experience as the current internet. Bitcoin core wallet did not make any UI/UX enhancement in ten years, and there is neither a core mobile version, nor any consideration of the current user experience, which indicates user-experience-centralization. Some people are planning to deploy lightning network, allowing more centralized companies to join the nodes, turning the Bitcoin system into a centralized payment system with far worse user experience than visa.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    Many believes that the existing Bitcoin system needs to be changed or overturned, keeping the decentralization spirit and involve everyone in this revolution. DePINC has a more economical decentralization approach, using lower cost storage instead of CPU/GPU power. If we believe that centralization can cause crisis to reappear, then we need to know that monopoly has to be eliminated to avoid any risk of potential crisis in the crypto world.
\end{flushleft}
\subsection{Power Centralization}
\begin{flushleft}
    We mentioned, the main reason for Bitcoin to prevail and be successfully used as the digital money is that its hash power has been maintained at a relatively high level. In 2017, Bitcoin hash power was 4400P, daily production was 1,800 coins, every peta hash power generated 0.4 Bitcoin on average, and consisted of 166 units of 6 tera hash power mining machine. Here comes the issue, the price of Bitcoin can be influenced by mining machine manufacturers through adjusting the price of the mining machine. Thus as crypto currency participants anticipate an increase in Bitcoin's earnings, everyone is willing to mine with higher hash power machines, and enjoy a higher possibility to get rewards through packaging. The top four companies in Bitcoin mining account for about $53\%$ of the mining share; The Ethereum system has a higher concentration ratio, the top three mining agencies account for $61\%$ of the mining share. In addition, $56\%$ of the world's Bitcoin mining software and $28\%$ of Ethereum mining software are concentrated in the data center, showing that Bitcoin's operations are more corporatized.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    The figure below shows that now Bitcoin's hash power is about 30,000P - 40,000P. Compared to year 2017, the hash power has increased by 10 times, which means the difficulty has also increased by 10 times for participants.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    As shown in the figure below, the hash power has begun to be corporatized, or organized as pools nowadays, e.g. F2Pool, AntPool, Slush.
\end{flushleft}
\input{graph-mining_pool_hash_power}
\begin{flushleft}
    As hash power gradually increased, the mining machine manufacturers raised the difficulty of coin generation by making devices with improved configuration, kicking out many out-of-date device holders and discouraging a large amount of new entrant.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    DePINC solves the problem by using hard disk related consensus to disperse centralized hash power. In the existing PoW crypto currency, each collision of the hash value requires a large amount of calculation, which is of course also a method of managing difficulty. DePINC writes the results of each collision on the hard disk in a pre-computed way. This is also a common time-for-space method to reconstruct the entire calculation. That is to say, under different block difficulties, it takes time and calculation, which takes power consumption differently. While in the DePINC system, as long as the hard disk has enough storage space to contain a sufficient amount of answers the system can involve every crypto enthusiast in the block generation process, without the need for repeated large amount of calculations.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    Bitcoin block generation process is roughly like the scrabble game, combining hints with given characters to form a complete word. It is hard for beginners to figure out what the word is, and not easy or at least time consuming even for the veterans. Comparatively, DePINC is more like using a search engine, e.g. Google, to find the word, since the results are all pre-calculated. So the more words in the database, the higher the possibility to get the result. Compared with Bitcoin, DePINC has a much lower barrier to entry, and is much more accessible for every individual.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    The problem of hash power centralization can be resolved through such a space-for-time approach. Of course, this is just one of the problems DePINC targets.
\end{flushleft}
\subsection{Energy Consumption}
\begin{flushleft}
    The concentration of hash power also brings about the problem of high energy consumption. So how much resources does the specific calculation consume?
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    To give an example, the current energy usage level of Bitcoin is enough to generate electricity for $10\%$ of Italy, as shown by the figure below. That is to say, the resources used by Bitcoin could meet the needs of Rome, Milan and Venice, with a combined population of 6 million. Just as a popular saying all roads goes to Rome, if the Bitcoin makes its way to Rome, it will also consume all of Rome's electricity.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    \centering\textbf{Bitcoin Energy Consumption Relative to Serveral Countries}
\end{flushleft}
\input{graph-energy_consumption_relative_countries}
\begin{flushleft}
    Since most miners are in mainland China (e.g. BitMain the famous manufacturer), I will give a Chinese example. Now that Bitcoin's hash power is around 45EHash/s, then in the case of 1 peta computing power and 0.1 yuan per kWh, it takes about 140000 kWh to do the specific calculation, costing an average of 14,000 yuan. China's high-speed railway consumes more than 9,600 kilowatt-hours per hour. For the 5 hour trip from Shanghai to Beijing, the train needs to use nearly 48,000 kWh. The current energy consumption of a Bitcoin is more than enough for a high-speed rail to run a return trip from Beijing to Shanghai.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    So what is the energy consumption of DePINC?
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    According to the comparison between a current second-hand S9 and a current second-hand 8 terabyte hard drive, the energy consumption ratio is about 1/300. That is, for 200 USD equivalent of electricity, ASIC takes 1700 watts, GPU takes 250 watts. Comparing those to 8 TB hard disk which cost around 200 USD, the hard disk takes only 5 watts. So for spending on 100 S9 or 100 8 TB hard disk devices with the same total amount of money, the S9 ones consume 122,400 kWh monthly, while for mining DePINC hard disk ones consume 360 kWh, which is equal to only 5 days of electricity for an average American family. That makes DePINC more accessible for anyone interested to participate and contribute in the long term. With such huge difference, the energy saved can be spent on more entities rather than on repeated consumption. Unlike Bitcoin which has slowly become a game for only few, DePINC’s low power requirement keeps its door open for many.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    Another energy related issue is even more serious: PoW's hash power is reflected in energy consumption, but energy is controlled by the national government in most countries, hence with the expansion of hash power, the impact of energy will gradually increase.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    It is shown in the figure below, the energy consumption of Bitcoin was 73,121 TWh in October 2018, and decreased drastically to 44,722 TWh in January 2019. This fall in computing power caused by energy reduction affected the difficulty level of the entire block and the profit of mining machines. This disaster did not only hit Bitcoin. The minor crypto currencies with PoW consensus had to take the risk of forking. It was a deadly threat to the correctness and validity of the entire consensus.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    \centering\textbf{Bitcoin Energy Consumption 2017-2022}
\end{flushleft}
\input{graph-energy_consumption_of_bitcoin}
\begin{flushleft}
    That is to say, if the mining pool is concentrated under any centralized institution, then the institution can influence the system's difficulty level and benefits by adjusting the relevant energy resources. The computing power would drop dramatically due to a potential large-scale electricity power decline, which could even cause a PoW coin to fork. The low power consumption of DePINC also provides an effective solution to this problem, through reducing the dependence on energy and taking a block generation approach that is more suitable for long-term survival. The PoS consensus is a low-energy-cost alternative to the current high-energy-cost ASIC based ones. By using the whole global hard disk storage as medium, PoS generates random numbers to guarantee high level of security, and ensures stability of the blockchain infrastructure.
\end{flushleft}
\section{Seeking Alternatives}
\subsection{Lower Power Consumption}
\begin{flushleft}
    When numerous resources are being used in the mining procedure and costs are gradually increasing, crypto currency enthusiasts have started looking for alternatives to lower power consumption in two different ways: either using new consensus to lower energy cost or using more general apparatus to lower the cost of mass production. The golden age of ASIC mining device and anti-ASIC algorithm implementation had come. The original intention of Ethereum and Monero was to resist ASIC, using a different non-ASIC-friendly consensus to keep the system away from ASIC manufacturers’ manipulation while keeping the energy consumption low. However after a period of time, ASIC manufacturers still found ways to design devices that would work with the corresponding algorithm. Among those ASIC ones, Litecoin has to be mentioned. It started with Scrypt which is an anti-ASIC mining algorithm, and soon ASIC manufacturers started producing ASIC mining devices that could work with Scrypt.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    As the number of crypto enthusiasts increases, the idea of decentralization has gotten bigger. Of course, everyone who is in the industry wants to be able to benefit. As Bitcoin's energy consumption is increasing each day, mining machine manufacturers are becoming more centralized. The crypto currencies based on PoS is in more demand now than ever. In addition, PoS consensus mechanism guarantees that the difficulty level can be quickly controlled, accumulate enough to maintain the normal operation of the system, and reward the transactions. DePINC is superior to the existing crypto currencies in all the above areas. Its technology has been improved on the basis of Chia, and completely surpasses many other crypto currencies in technical and community dimensions.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    Compared to the overhead energy assurance algorithm, we believe that low power consumption can also give the algorithm enough credit to ensure that everyone can use crypto currency in the future in more scenarios.
\end{flushleft}
\subsection{Proof of Space Time}
\begin{flushleft}
    DePINC provides the perfect solution for the issues mentioned above. It brings a method for crypto zealot to make general apparatus while keeping the energy consumption low. Meanwhile, DePINC maintains a relatively high difficulty level to ensure the stability of the system by using its consensus Proof of Space Time (abbr. PoST). The PoST consensus used by DePINC is also one of the most decentralized consensus mechanisms in this era. Compared with the PoW, where hash power rules, the PoST consensus is ruled by storage power, but slightly different from the cloud storage. PoST utilizes hard disks as a more economical consensus method, so that more people can participate in construction of the system-stabilizing hash power with their own devices. It was the original intention of Nakamoto to design PoW, a decentralized system and an innovative path to real decentralization for everyone, raising consciousness in every new comer to think about and overturn the existing design. DePINC has inherited BTC’s spirit, now the new PoST mechanism is responsible for bringing a better future for crypto currency, and engaging more people in the construction of the economic system.
\end{flushleft}
\section{DePIN Protocol Hub}
\subsection{Integrating algorithms}
\begin{flushleft}
    DePINC aims to establish itself as a DePIN Protocol Hub, integrating validated algorithms for storage and computing. By offering a diverse range of flexible protocol combinations, DePINC provides users with efficient, secure, and flexible decentralized infrastructure solutions all in one place.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    Specifically, DePINC begins with reusable storage protocols. As technology advances, DePINC will gradually expand into more protocols covering areas such as computing and data processing. Through this approach, DePINC is dedicated to constructing a multi-layered, multifunctional decentralized ecosystem that comprehensively supports decentralized services for users.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    The project's native token is DePC, a novel cryptocurrency based on the CPoST (Conditional Proof of Space Time) consensus mechanism. By involving hard drives as consensus participants, DePINC significantly reduces energy consumption and entry barriers, making the cryptocurrency more secure, decentralized, and accessible to everyone.
\end{flushleft}
\subsection{Improved Bitcoin}
\begin{flushleft}
    In comparison to Bitcoin, which utilizes the PoW (Proof of Work) consensus mechanism to establish a secure peer-to-peer system, DePINC addresses the issue of high energy consumption and monopolization of electricity resources. Despite the reliability and simplicity of PoW, it disregards concerns over resource consumption and future energy monopolies. With the increasing resource consumption of Bitcoin, more environmentally friendly consensus protocols have emerged. One such protocol is Proof of Space-Time, which, like PoW, ensures security but with significantly lower energy consumption. DePINC adopts this excellent consensus mechanism as a solution to Bitcoin's high energy consumption issues, ensuring network security, system stability, and a notable reduction in energy consumption.
\end{flushleft}
